        <li>Children's Privacy Notice
          <p>Salta3 Burger understands the importance of privacy of users of our Online Services. We are especially
            committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our Online Services. This Children's
            Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our practices with respect to personal
            information we collect through our Online Services from children under the age of [13].</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>What Personal Information Does Salta3 Burger Collect?
              <p>On occasion, we may collect personal information, such as an email address from children as part of an
                activity. For example:</p>
              <p>We may collect a child's email address to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest,
                competition, prize draw or sweepstakes. In that event, we will notify the child using the email address
                the child supplies. We will not keep the email address or use it for any other purpose.</p>
              <p>We may collect a child's email address in order to respond to a request from the child on a one-time
                basis. In this case we promptly delete the email address from our system once we have responded, and we
                do not use the address for any other purpose.</p>
              <p>We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of [13], such as a [postal
                address] or telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. If parent or guardian consent
                is required, we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our
                information practices and/or seek the parent's or guardian's consent.</p>
              <p>Salta3 Burger will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's
                disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>How Does Salta3 Burger Use the Personal Information It Collects?
              <p>We use email addresses submitted by a child in order to respond to the child's request or to notify the
                child if he or she has won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstakes they entered. We
                use the email address of a parent or guardian in order to provide the parent notice of our information
                practices or to seek the parent's or guardian's consent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>How Does Salta3 Burger Share Personal Information?
              <p>We may share a child's personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to
                protect the security or integrity of our Online Services, take precautions against liability, or respond
                to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities, or when we believe disclosure is
                necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an
                investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>
              <p>We also may share personal information collected from children with vendors that perform services for
                Salta3 Burger. These services may include hosting our Sites, providing technical services to Salta3
                Burger, fulfilling requests or administering a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstakes. We do
                not authorize such vendors to disclose the personal information we share with them other than as
                necessary to perform the relevant service for Salta3 Burger.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Requests from Parents Regarding Our Children's Privacy Practices.
              <p>Parents may review personal information we have collected from their child that has not been deleted
                and can request that the personal information be deleted from our records if it has not been already.
                Parents also may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's personal information, when
                the parent has previously provided consent. To do so, please contact us at the address, telephone number
                or email address provided below with your request.</p>

            described in this Privacy Statement under 'How We Use the Information We Collect.'</p>
          <p>Cookies</p>
          <p>A 'cookie' is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to
            uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Like most
            websites, Salta3 Burger uses cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience.
            For example, we track the total number of visitors to our Sites on an anonymous aggregate basis. We may also
            employ cookies so that we remember you when you return to the Site, to keep track of the items in your
            shopping cart if you purchase merchandise online, to administer certain contests and sweepstakes and to help
            customize your Salta3 Burger web experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in
            those instances. Both we and others (such as out advertising networks) may collect personal information
            about our visitors’ online activities, overtime and across third-party websites, when using our Online
            services.</p>
          <p>Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your
            browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Click on the 'Help' section of your browser to learn how to

            features of this Site.</p>
          <p>Other Technologies</p>
          <p>We may use other technologies, including web beacons and JavaScript, which sometimes work together with
            cookies and other means with our Sites and Mobile Apps to uniquely identify your device. These other
            technologies help enable features on our Sites and within our Mobile Apps.</p>

            session-based (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). You are always free to decline tracking
            technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of Online Services.</p>

            details and explains how to exercise your choices.</p>
          <p>You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow
            us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. These networks
            track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through
            the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other technologies. The networks use this information

            networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant
