        employment policies and practices. Neither Salta3 Burger nor its parent company employs independent
        franchisees. If you are hired by a restaurant that is a franchisee, only that franchisee, and not Salta3 Burger
        or its parent company (Salta3 Burger Corporation), will be your employer.</p>
