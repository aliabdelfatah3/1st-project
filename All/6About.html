      <p>We at Salta3 Burger believe that with quality comes success.</p>
      <p>This formula is one we tested and tried. We strived for perfection, right</p>
      <p>from the beginning. We set goals and promised ourselves that our</p>
      <p>costumers weren’t only going to taste the best burgers, snacks, and</p>
      <p>side dishes in town, but they were also going to receive the best service and experience.</p>
    
      <p>Today we can proudly say that what we hoped for and aimed at from
        the very beginning, has been achieved. The happy faces and
        compliments we get from customers is what makesus want to work
        harder.</p>
      <p>In 2016, we opened our first Salta3 Burger. </p>
      <p>The restaurant was a
        humble burger spot, located in Nasr City, near the district’s most
        popular places. But soon enough the place couldn’t keep up with
        people’s demand and hunger for more.</p>
      <p>August 2017 is when our second pearl was born. We chose Patio Mall in
        New Cairo as the location for our second branch.</p>
      <p>We did this to ensure
        our customers in New Cairo wouldn’t have to go far to experience the
        burger sensation everyone in town is talking about.
        </p>
      <p>The Company continued expanding our brand to open in El Sheikh
        Zayed in June 2018 and in Dokki in April 2019.</p>
      <p>We are proud of our success and achievements, and we will make sure
        to keep our standards highs to guarantee our customer’s satisfsaction.</p>
